### Notes
- Make sure to install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in your project directory.
- You can choose to use either the Vue or React component by modifying the `main.ts` file accordingly.
- This is a basic setup; you may want to expand upon it based on your project's requirements.

Feel free to modify any part of the code to better suit your needs! If you have any specific features or functionalities in mind, let me know!
